# GitHub Search Angular

This repo will be archived soon, as it's been coded in Angular 5. And updating it from 5 to 12 is bit of troublesome. So decided create a newer version of this (with more features) using latest Angular and TailwindCSS. Link of the new repo will be updated here soon.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
